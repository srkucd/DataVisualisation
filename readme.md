## by (your name here)


## Dataset

> Here, I use prosper loan data with some wrangling. I choose 'CreditGrade','BorrowerRate','BorrowerState','LoanOriginalAmount','IsBorrowerHomeowner','TotalCreditLinespast7years','DelinquenciesLast7Years' columns to finish the visualisation.


## Summary of Findings

> If a person has better credit rank, this means he or she can borrow money with lower interests. People with low interests have to loan less money in higher interest rates. Ownership of a property can also helps. People without property almost cannot borrow money more than 25000 in low interest rate.

> People's loan status are related to where they live.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I was trying to find the relationship between geographic location and loan status. We can find some interesting result. East/west coast people loan more money than the rest of country, but their credit rank and average bad debt rate are not that low. And we can see some regular patterns on the map, such as some states have very serious bad debt situation and their average loan price is also lower than their neighborhood. We cannot say which one comes first, but we know they must have some relationship.
